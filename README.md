Tic Tac Toe using Monte Carlo simulation. Goal is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row.

# Running the game
Download the python file and game assets (maintain the directory structure - i.e. the images and sounds folders should be in the same folder as the python file).

Download the [Pygame module](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

To start the game you'd run `$ python tic_tac_toe.py` 

# Controls
Click a square to make a move in that space

New Game starts a new game (only if no game is in progress)

Switch Symbol switches between X and O. X always goes first and, by default, the computer starts as X.

Reverse switches between regular Tic Tac Toe (the default) and reverse Tic Tac Toe. In reverse Tic Tac Toe, whoever gets three in a row loses.
